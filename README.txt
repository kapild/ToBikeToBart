ToBikeToBart:

This is a very simple android app, which uses BART API. The purpose of the app is to tell user whether he is allowed to carry his bike to bart or not.

The input is arrival and departure station, along with a specific time he/she wish to travel. Then the app calls the BART API, stating whether he can carry his bike
on the following trains. 

I face this problem when I am biking to/back from work. At times I dont wanna bike and would like to BART with bike instead. 
Hence, ToBikeToBart

Other funny names : ToBOrNotToBToB: TO bike or not to bike to BART
